# Halfassed Mail (handler)

A challenge for me, that I can actually create something simple and usable in Ruby.

No, I don't care for bad code practice, because I just don't give a fucking shit. If something blows up,
I can only blame myself.

## tl;dr what's this
Halfassed mail handler, written in Ruby, utilizing Mailgun, MySQL, TOTP authentication and emojis. Including bad code so everyone would keep away >:).
